These are all firmware projects that I can provide that I have done during my independent study of electronics. All these progrms are written in AVR-C and include orginal code used in various projects
Here's a description of each project.

# SPI_FAT / SPI_Fatfs

both attemtps at interfacing a microSD card and orginizing it's informaiton using a FAT (file access system) both were unsuccesful due to hardware issues that might have to do with the microSD card size (at least that could be a reason based on a similar problem that I saw online) It was useful in understanding the basics of synchronous serial communication protocols and understand more about SPI and how to use it in AVR based applications

# BIT_SCR

a successful attempt at interfacing a oled screen with I2C with a atmega328p microcontroller. this program is capable of drawing pixels at various points on the screen and drawing rectangles. It is also capable of creating patters and animations. Also useful in understanding synchronous serial communication protocols and I2C itself.

# LED_BLINK_555

not much of an impressive program but it was a test to expeirment with other AVR microcontroller models. Software desgined to test hardware and that's pretty much it.
